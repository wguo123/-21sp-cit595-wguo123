I am so excited to join CIT 595 in the summer!

I would like to further deepen my understanding of C language as well as how it works with the computer systems, especially how the memory management is workingand how the programs are working with hardware.

I have some experience using Git system in my past learning and working experience. I am still curious all kinds of git tricks and tips to imrpove my development efficiency.

This line is to test adding new text into README file.
